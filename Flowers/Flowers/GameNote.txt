============================
	Objectives
============================
Objectives of this demo is to write a simple 2d game with the ported engine code for XNA to identify remaining bugs and to finally write something in XNA. I 
am expecting this demo to be my highest poilished demo. I am hoping to get the whole game functional within 10 hours and polish there after.


============================
	Core(Phase 1)
============================
Raw version of the game functional with programmer art
[*]Planning
[*]Placeholder art
[*]Model objects
[*]Make each model script accessible
[*]Render basic background with programmer art
[*]Render the board
[*]Render pieces on click
[*]Render basic HUD
[*]Implement easy
[*]Implement board state mechanics (Cats game/Win/etc)		--Lock up on cats games atm(logging for the night..figure out tomorrow)
[*]Implement moderate difficulty
[*]Render main menu screen
[*]Render in game menu screen
[*]Implement flow mechanism
[]*Implement Min Max algorithm (Impossible AI)
[]Implement Alpha/Beta pruning on the algorithm to make it faster...although in TicTacToe you will never see this performance increase...this is more of a best practises step


============================
	Polish(Phase 2)
============================
Replace the programmer art with real art and make the game not only maintain its functionality but also add a nice playable environment
[*]Background
[*]Screen fades in and out
[*]All sprites not part of the winning line do their dying animation
[*]Sun sprite
[*]Clouds
[*]House
[*]Fence
[*]Garden
[*]Bush around the gardens edge
[]Smoke particles from the house's chimney
[*]Delay computers move by a CONSTANT so it doesn't move right away
[]Sfx
